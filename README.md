This repository contains a small shell implementation that has some basic file management commands and a tiny VCS called Tracker.
It was developed for educational purposes during the [Functional Programming course](https://github.com/jagajaga/itmo-fp-2020) at ITMO University.
Inspired by [crosh](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform2/+/master/crosh/README.md).
